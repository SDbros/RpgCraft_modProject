RpgCraft wip
-------------------------------------------

RpgCraft will add rpg like elemets to minecraft.

Features:
Scaling world with stronger enemy’s and better loot the further you get from spawn.
Some sort of leveling system.
Checkpoint like portals so you can build a base somewhere and still venture further out.
New ore’s armor and weapons.
If possible new mobs
New biomes (getting more extreme the further from spawn you go)
Generated structures to work as dungeons with bosses and loot at the end
Make nether and end a lot more difficult with the ender dragon being a real end boss
Use the village raid for base raids
