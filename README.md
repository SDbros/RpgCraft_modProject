# RpgCraft

RpgCraft is a work in progress mod that will add rpg like elements to minecraft.

Features include:

A scaling world with stronger enemy’s and better loot the further you get from spawn
with generated structures to work as dungeons with bosses and loot at the end.

A checkpoint portal system so you can build a base somewhere and still venture further out.

A leveling system based on permanent enchants.

New biomes (getting more extreme the further from spawn you go)
New ore’s, armor, weapons, mobs and more.

There are also plans to make the Nether and End more difficult with the enderdragon being a real end boss.
